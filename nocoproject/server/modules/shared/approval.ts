/**
 * The approval gate seam (docs/phase1/iteration-2-contract.md §D, 方案 §8).
 *
 * Business modules depend on this interface only. Today's implementation is `approval/approval.gateway.ts`
 * (`DbApprovalGateway`, the `approvalRequests` table), which is @temporary(nocobase-official): 待替换为 NocoBase 官方
 * 工作流审批. When the official capability ships, a new `ApprovalGateway` replaces it wholesale; the status enum
 * (`APPROVAL_STATUSES`), the approver roles and the domain event names below must not change. The "替换检查清单" test
 * (`tests/logic/np-approval.test.ts`) runs the same cases against the database gateway and an in-memory double.
 *
 * Rules every implementation keeps:
 * - `gate` is called by the status machine before a transition is applied, inside that transaction. A transition
 *   without `approval`, a system actor, an actor who is one of the approvers, or approvers that resolve to nobody →
 *   `pass` (with the reason). Otherwise a pending request is created, the status stays, and approvers are asked.
 * - A second pending request for the same issue and target status → 409 `APPROVAL_PENDING`.
 * - `approve` applies the transition on the approver's behalf (through `ApprovalHooks.applyTransition`); `reject`
 *   leaves the status. Only a listed approver may decide (403); a decided request → 409 `APPROVAL_DECIDED`.
 * - `cancelStale` cancels pending requests of an issue whose status moved by another path, or became terminal.
