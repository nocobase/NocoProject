/**
 * NocoProject protocol types: signals — an outside system reports that an issue's linked object needs its
 * executor's attention, and a rule a person configured decides whether the executor agent is woken up.
 *
 * The core knows nothing about where a signal comes from: a source (today only the GitHub integration) names the
 * signal `kind`, a stable `key` for de-duplication, a one-line title, a link and a default instruction. Whether a
 * kind wakes the executor, how often in a row, and with which instruction are workspace settings (`signalRules`),
 * off until a person turns them on — a workspace that never enables a rule never sees a signal run. When workflows
 * are orchestrated per domain later, only where the rule is read from changes; the trigger and its payload stay.
 *
 * Server source of truth; the CLI copies this file with `pnpm sync-protocol`. This file only imports types from the
 * earlier protocol files. Additive only.
