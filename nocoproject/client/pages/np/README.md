# NocoProject pages: UI rules

The design system is `nocosolution/frontend/nocobase3-frontend-best-practices.md` (any NocoBase 3 app) plus `nocosolution/frontend/nocosolution-frontend-standard.md` (what every NocoSolution must share); this file is their implementation checklist for `client/pages/np/`. NocoProject used to keep a separate `docs/design/ui-design.md`; it has been folded into those two docs and this file (§11 keeps what was NocoProject-specific: the shell layout and the screenshot/token inventory) and no longer exists — do not recreate it. Every page under `client/pages/np/` follows the rules here, but a design decision the product owner or user states explicitly for a page — even a one-line request, not written down anywhere — outranks all of it; update this file afterward so it stops saying one thing while the page does another. Start from `client/pages/reference/examples` (orders, team-settings, inbox, dashboard) for structure and density, and from `client/pages/reference/components` for component APIs — copy structure, never import.

## 0. Styling under the compact preset

NocoBase ships compact as the default preset: it sets `--spacing: 0.2rem` (20% under Tailwind's 0.25rem), so every `p-*`, `gap-*`, `h-*` and `w-*` shrinks. Our pages had picked values that were already tight under the default preset (32px nav rows, `size-8` header buttons, `w-72` board columns) and used `text-xs` for body copy, so under compact they looked cramped. Rules:

- Never override `--spacing` or any preset token at page level, and never give one page its own density.
- Size with the spacing scale and component size variants: buttons default / `sm` / `icon-sm`, the template's navigation row, the `DataTable` default row, cards `p-4` / `p-5`. No hand-picked tight values.
- Body text `text-sm`; `text-xs` only for captions and metadata; tags use `NpTag` (12px).
- Hit targets never below `icon-sm`.
- Layout widths that must not shrink are written in rem with a comment: side column `20rem`, inbox list `26rem`, board column `18rem`.
- Check both presets (compact, default) and both modes (light, dark): `pnpm build && pnpm screenshots` writes all four combinations of every page to `output/screenshots/` from a throwaway preview of this checkout (`docs/dogfooding.md`); attach them to the delivery.

## 1. Page frame

- A top-level page is `PageContainer` + `PageHeader` (title = the menu name, one sentence of description, the one primary action rightmost). No `max-w-*` or `mx-auto` at page level.
- Only form and dialog content are width-limited (`FieldGroup className='max-w-2xl'`, the dialog's content).
- Page tabs are child routes (`NpRouteTabs` + default-tab redirect). Sections inside a covering detail page use `NpTabBar` with `?tab=`, because the detail's child routes are its dialogs. Both look the same.
- `/issues` and `/my-issues` fill the content area: header, toolbar, then the board or the table in a bounded area (`PageContainer className='flex h-full min-h-0 flex-col gap-6 space-y-0'`, `IssueBoard fill`, `DataTable fillHeight`). The page itself does not scroll.
- Every top-level page renders `NpShortcuts` once (§8).
- A page that is one conversation (`/pm`) fills the content area like `/issues`: header, then `SessionPanel fill` — only its message list scrolls, the composer stays under it, no properties column.

## 2. Lists and tables

- Toolbar on the left (search, filters, view switch — `IssueToolbar`), the primary button in the page header.
- Creating issues is one "新建任务" button and one dialog (`/issues/new`, `NewIssueButton`), never a split button: tabs AI 整理 (default; describe or paste, choose the project, "整理" → batch entry's drafts table → create one or many) and 手动 (the single-issue form). The last tab is remembered in `localStorage` (`nocoproject:new-issue-tab`, try/catch), `?tab=` overrides, `?batch=` holds the open draft batch and `?project=` preselects the project. Old batch-entry routes redirect into the AI tab.
- The board shows the design-first columns (分析中, 方案待审) only while one holds an issue or a visible issue is design-first (`withoutIdleDesignColumns`).
- Lists are `DataTable`. Server-paged lists pass `pagination={false}` and put "Load more" under the table; client-paged lists keep `pageSize={20}`.
- Column widths go in `meta.className`: fixed widths for identifier, status, priority, people and dates; the title column `w-full max-w-0` with a single-line truncated cell capped at `max-w-[30rem]` and a `title` tooltip. One long title never stretches a table.
- Sortable headers use `DataTableColumnHeader`: a click cycles ascending → descending → unsorted, the icon shows the state, there is no menu on the header. Column hiding lives in `DataTableViewOptions`.
- `/issues` and `/my-issues` open on the board. The list / board choice is remembered per page in `localStorage` (`nocoproject:issues-view:<page>`, every access in try/catch); `?view=` overrides and is always written explicitly.
- Loading: `NpListSkeleton` (or a skeleton shaped like the content). Empty: `NpEmpty` (icon, title, one sentence of fact, the create action). Failed: `NpLoadError` (retry, none on 403).

## 3. Detail pages

- A record's page is a covering `RouteChildPage`. The issue and knowledge details use `NpDetailLayout` (main column `flex-1 min-w-0`, side column fixed `20rem` holding small cards, sticky below the page header from `lg` up unless taller than the viewport, one column below `lg`); the project detail is a header, `NpTabBar` and the tab's content.
- **One scroll container.** The covering page scrolls as a whole; neither column scrolls on its own. The issue composer is `sticky bottom-0` inside the main column.
- The main column starts with `Breadcrumbs` and the record's `text-2xl` title, then one meta line (identifier, status, project, and `NpLiveRun` while a run is active). Blocks are bordered cards (`rounded-lg border bg-card p-4`) headed by `NpSectionHeading`, `space-y-6` apart.
- **Empty sections take no room.** No description is one muted row with "edit"; empty sub-issues fold into one dashed row with its actions; attachments (right under the description, NP-78), pull requests and dependencies render only with content or once revealed from the "添加" chips under the description; approvals and proposals render only when pending.
- Loading uses `NpDetailSkeleton`; 404/403 uses an error with "back to the list".

## 4. Decisions

- A decision is always shown with the thing being decided in full (`DecisionContent`: the agent's delivery comment and PR, the approval's from → to and requester, the proposals, the knowledge text with its diff, the design proposal in Markdown for `design_review`) and the actions right under it (`DecisionActionsBar`). Never a bare "accept".
- The inbox (`/inbox`) is master–detail: grouped list on the left (decisions first), the selected item's context under a sticky action bar on the right, `j` / `k` / `e` / Enter, `?tab=` / `?archived=1` / `?item=` in the URL, list → detail on narrow screens.
- The inbox reminder: the sidebar entry carries the count of decisions still waiting on the viewer (`GET /np/inbox/pending-count`, NP-107), and a short Web Audio chime plays when that count goes up after the first load (NP-108, `inbox/inbox-chime.ts`). The chime is on by default and every member can turn it off per browser (`localStorage` `np:inbox:chime`), either under 设置 → 通用 → 我的提醒 (`config/chime-preference.tsx`, editable even when the workspace settings below it are read-only) or from the speaker button in the inbox header, needs one user gesture in the tab before the browser lets it sound, and plays in only one tab at a time (Web Lock).
- The issue page shows the viewer's open decisions on that issue ("等你决定", `GET /np/inbox?kind=decision&resolved=false&issueId=`); a decided card folds into one line for the rest of the visit.
- Both run decisions through `useDecisionRunner` (optimistic resolve in every cached inbox list, toast, refetch on failure). Button hierarchy: the primary action is the one filled button and comes first; other requests outlined; rejection red; navigation (open, reassign) plain text. Type-specific wording goes in `np.decision.actions.<type>.<key>`.

## 5. Identifiers, tags, people, empty values

- Identifiers, slugs, versions, branches: `font-mono text-xs`.
- The process is marked only when it changes what happens next: `NpProcessBadge` ("先出方案", blue, compass icon) beside the status in the issue header and on board cards, nothing for direct issues. Timeline comments that are a design proposal or a retrospective note carry `NpCommentTag` ("方案" / "总结").
- Executor pickers (`NpExecutorSelect`) never offer a project manager agent (`kind: 'manager'`), except one already set.
- Every tag is `NpTag` (tinted pill: pale background, darker text of the same hue, 12px, dot for statuses) with its tone from one map. Status: `NpStatusBadge` (tone by meaning via `statusTone`: unstarted grey, started blue, in review violet, blocked amber, done green, cancelled slate). Priority: `NpPriorityLabel` (urgent red, high orange, medium blue, low grey). Runs: `NpRunStatusBadge`. Labels: `NpLabelChip`. Never a solid fill, never a dot on a neutral pill, never the shadcn `Badge` on these pages.
- People, agents and the system: only `NpActorAvatar` (initials round / bot rounded-square in the agent hue / dashed cog; `live` for a working agent). `NpExecutor` builds on it.
- Empty values (no priority, executor, owner, date, project) render a muted "—" with the word kept for screen readers. Editable controls keep their "none" option names in the list only.

## 6. Feedback and copy

- Every explicit write action toasts on success and on failure; failures are localized (`np.common.forbidden`, `np.common.requestFailed`, or a specific key for 409s).
- Inline property edits and emoji reactions change in place and toast only on failure.
- Destructive actions go through `AlertDialog` with a `destructive` action.
- UI text states facts and actions and never explains the UI: no "在这里可以…", "下面是…", "就在这里决定…". An empty state's sentence is a fact, not an instruction.

## 7. Colour, motion, themes

- Colours are tokens only. Neutrals, primary and charts come from the theme presets; NocoProject's own semantic colours (`--agent`, `--attention`, `--success`, `--np-tint-*` / `--np-ink-*`) live in `client/np-tones.css`. Accent (primary) only for primary actions, focus and live state; amber only for "needs you".
- Motion explains change and respects reduced motion: realtime inbox arrivals slide in, resolved decisions dim, running work pulses (`NpPulse`, `np-live-ring`), progress rings animate.

## 8. Keyboard

- `C` opens "New issue" (on `/issues` the create dialog beside the list), ignored while typing or when a dialog is open.
- `⌘K` / `Ctrl+K` opens the issue search; Enter opens the highlighted issue.
- `⌘Enter` sends a comment, saves a knowledge document, sends an inline decision comment.
- In the inbox: `j` / `k` move, `e` archives, Enter opens the issue.

## 9. Long lists

- Cursor pages (`useInfiniteQuery`): the issue list, board columns ("load more" per column), older issue activities, the inbox groups.
- Virtualization (`react-virtuoso`): the activity timeline and board columns past 100 items (`NpVirtualList`), the issue table past 200 rows (`DataTable virtualizeAfter`), measured against the nearest scrolling ancestor.
- Query keys sit under the family the realtime topics invalidate (`npKeys.issues`, `npKeys.issue(id)`, `npKeys.inbox`).

## 10. Languages

- Every string is a key in `client/locales/` with `en-US` and `zh-CN`; `tests/logic/locale-coverage.test.ts` fails on a missing key. New groups go in the latest `np-*-en-US.ts` (today `np-iter4-en-US.ts`); a key inside an existing group goes into the file that defines that group, since the spread into `np` is shallow; avoid i18next plural suffixes.

## 11. Shell, screenshots and token inventory

NocoProject-specific reference material that doesn't belong in the two shared design docs because no other Solution needs it verbatim:

- **Shell**: brand mark, top bar (collapse toggle, workspace name, appearance, account) above a flat sidebar — 收件箱 → 我的任务 → 工作（任务、项目）→ AGENT 团队（Agent、运行时、技能、知识库）→ 报表 → 设置. Top bar and sidebar keep the template's own sizes (`h-16`, `size-10` / `size-9` icon buttons); they are already sized for the compact preset, so they are not compressed further.
- **Screenshots**: 1360×900 desktop viewport, `docs/design/screenshots/` holds the last reviewed baseline (compact · dark as the primary shot, plus a light and a default-preset counterpart per page: inbox, issue detail, project detail, board, issue list, knowledge, reports, settings). Day-to-day verification doesn't update that baseline — `pnpm build && pnpm screenshots` regenerates the same four combinations (compact/default × light/dark) into `output/screenshots/` from a throwaway local preview (`docs/dogfooding.md` "看效果"); attach those to the delivery instead.
- **Token and file inventory**:
  - Theme presets (`client/theme/themes/{compact,default}.css`, identical except density): cool-toned neutrals, `--primary` indigo, `--chart-1..5` fixed hues, an independent sidebar background, selected nav text in the body color.
  - App semantic colours (`client/np-tones.css`): `--agent`, `--attention` / `--attention-foreground`, `--success`, `--np-tint-*` / `--np-ink-*` (eight hues), plus the `badge-text` and `np-live-ring` utilities (the latter in `client/styles.css`).
  - Flat sidebar sections: `client/layouts/components/navigation-sections.tsx` (the template's `navigation-tree.tsx` only gained the entry row styling and `relative`, and still owns the collapsible tree for Settings/Dev and for any group whose entry count needs it — see the best-practices doc §2.1 for when to switch).
