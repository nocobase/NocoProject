/**
 * Daemon version compatibility (NP-150). The server decides, at register, heartbeat and claim, whether a daemon may
 * keep working (`ok`), may keep working but should upgrade (`deprecated`), or must upgrade (`unsupported`). An
 * unsupported daemon is never refused outright: it stays registered and heartbeating, its runtimes show
 * `upgrade_required`, and claims return no runs, so the computer never silently turns "offline".
 *
 * Policy: a change an older daemon may safely ignore (an optional field) keeps the protocol version. A change an older
 * daemon would get wrong bumps `PROTOCOL_VERSION`, and the previous version stays at least `deprecated` for one
 * release. Raising `SUPPORTED_PROTOCOLS.min` (or `MIN_CLI_VERSION`) is only allowed when running on is unsafe, and the
 * pull request must say why.
 *
 * Protocol history:
 * - 1: Phase 0 to NP-125. NP-125 made the claim depend on agent configuration (`configurationProtocol: 1`, CLI
 *   0.4.0); a protocol 1 daemon without it would run agents with the wrong authority, so it is unsupported.
 * - 2: NP-150. Same payloads as protocol 1 with `configurationProtocol: 1`; adds negotiation and `compatibility`.
